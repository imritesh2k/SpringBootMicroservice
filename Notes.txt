spring-boot-microservice-currency-conversion >> client service

# Eureka Server
http://localhost:8761/

# Request 1
http://localhost:8100/currency-converter/feign/from/EUR/to/INR/quantity/10000

#Request 2
http://localhost:8100/currency-converter/feign/from/EUR/to/INR/quantity/10000

# Route the request through API gateway
http://localhost:8765/{application-name}/{uri}

#NOTE : If we dont give the server API Gateway details then it will not rout through the api gateway
http://localhost:8765/currency-conversion-service/currency-converter/feign/from/EUR/to/INR/quantity/10000

So, here right now we need to provide the explicitively the api gateway url to request to go through it, we can omit this with bit modifixcation in our client application controller
